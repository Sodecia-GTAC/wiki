### Other Recommended Personal Items
- Laundry Bag

- Crossbody bag (Great for keeping passport and other stuff you should always have on your person when travelling)
- Coin Purse (It's more common to not accept cards in Europe, so always keep some cash on you. A small coin purse with 2 or more sections is a good idea to keep different currencies/coins seperate)


## Travel Tips
- At security you're required to take your electronics out of your bag to put them all in a bin to be passed through an X-ray machine. It's a good idea to have them all together and ready to be taken out for security, and better yet, in smaller transparent bags (put your laptop adapter and mouse etc... in a smaller bag rather than pull 20 things out at once at security). This helps you not feel like an idiot when the pissed off TSA lady tells you something you already know in a shitty tone.

### Personal Items you may want but may not be necessary for everyone
- Nail clippers
- Toothbrush (With charger if applicable)
