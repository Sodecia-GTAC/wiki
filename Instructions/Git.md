### Practice
We have a practice repo located here: https://github.com/Sodecia-GTAC/Practice-Repo


Using what your learned in the "Using" section above and to help you get comfortable with Git, you may want to try the following (in order):

1. Clone the Practice Repo to create a local copy onto your laptop / PC
2. Make some changes to any of the test.txt files in the newly created local repo
3. Commit the changes. When Notepad opens to get your commit notes, add your name, date and some notes about what you changed
4. Push the commit to the remote repo
5. Check on Github that the commit was pushed successfully
