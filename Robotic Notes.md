VT_Direct() Setup/Info
1. Login to Expert mode to gain access to editing programs
2. Open program that VT_Direct is being added to
3. Add VT_Direct() between two motion lines that the turns direction needs to be controlled within.
4. Using the VT_Direct description below add the correct points, base and tool frames from each point.
The subprogram VT_DIRECT calculates the status of axis 5 at the end point in such a way that axes 4 and 6 are moved as little as possible. The program requires the coordinates X, Y, Z, A, B and C of start and end points as well as the status of the start point.

VT_Direct Example

VT_Direct("StartPoint", "EndPoint", "StartPointBaseFrame", "EndPointBaseFrame", "StartPointToolFrame", "EndPointToolFrame")
	
	PTP P5 Vel=100% PDAT5 Tool[1]:GUN BASE[1]:FIX1
	
	 VT_Direct(XP5, XP6, base_data[1], base_data[2], tool_data[1], tool_data[2])  
	
	PTP P6 Vel=100% PDAT6 Tool[2]:GRIPPER BASE[2]:FIX2
	
	Notes:
- if a point is entered with base_data[0] or tool_data[0], it should be entered as $nullframe instead, as tool and base data 0 do not exist

Gun Approximation Direction (Servo_TC)
1. Login to Expert Mode to gain access to all directories
2. Go to R1/TP/Servo_TC and open EG_ExternAuto 
3. Go to line ~40 and  change EG_DIRECTION_OF_TIPWEAR[x] from NZ > PZ or vice versa (x is the number of the external axis that is the gun)
4. Run a Cold Boot with Reload All Files to update the "boot files"
Gun Approximation Direction (ServoGunBasic)
- ONLY Changeable in WorkVisual (From my knowledge)

Change Maximum Tip Wear
1. Login to Expert Mode to gain access to all directories
2. Go to R1/TP/Servo_TC and open EG_ExternAuto
3. Go to line ~263 and change EG_WEAR_MAX[1] to desired maximum tip wear value.  DEFAULT=8mm
4. Run a Cold Boot with Reload All Files to update the "boot files"

Fix Gun Tip Wear E1+ Limit Error
1. Go into Display>Variable>Single and type EG_WEAR[x] (x = Ext gun #), and hit update. If the value displayed is higher than 8 then this is the reason of the error. 
2. Set the value of the variable to 0, and then Master the external axis at issue. 
3. Once the gun has been remaster, run tip wear and check the EG_WEAR[x] value. It should be very close to 0.

Increasing Weld Schedule Timeout
Display>Variable>Timer 13 is the schedule timer
1. Login to Expert Mode to have privilege's to write to variables. 
2. Open Display>Variable>Single
3. In the name field enter EG_TIMEOUT[2]
4. Update this value by entering a value in milliseconds within the "New Value" field. Default is 3000ms.
5. This is mainly needed for the tip dress schedule which can be up to 8 seconds long.

Servo_TC Option Package/Servo Gun Editor in
KUKA Work Visual Windows Application 
1. Open project in Work Visual
2. Activate project (must be activated) 
3. Highlight external drive (TS serial number)
4. Click Editor Tab on top bar
5. Click Option Packages in Editor Tab Menu
6. Click Servo Gun Editor

Decouple EXT Axis
1. Get Servo Tech on Status Keys (KUKA Menu>Configuration>Status Keys>ServoTech) 
2. Get Servo Power on Robot to Enable Status Key Functionality
3. Press Decouple of EXT Axis that is missing (3rd ServoTech page - gun icon with X through it)

Automatic Gun Calibration Tips
- Do automatic mastering first, 30mm space between movable and fixed shank (As specified by Kuka)
- DON'T USE WIZARD unless you are starting from scratch, it will zero all calibration data.  You must complete the full wizard and not do it partially.
  
- Turn of Sodecia SPS
- Shank Wear/Tip Wear should be reset/zero before doing gun calibration = SG_WEAR[x] and SG_TIPSEATING_MM[x] x= external axis
- Obara Max Flexion does not equate to Maximum Deflection (don't use Obara Deflection values)
- Applying 40% Torque and measuring the actual gun position can be used for  setting the 5 Pre-Calibration points by entering that position in the top field (IF automatic calibration is not working)
- Having the gun as a couple able axis could be a negative impact on the gun calibration as it changes the maximum safety velocity of E1 (E1 Speed must be 1500mm/s)
- For Max Flexion input 20mm, it will calculate itself during the automated process
- Opening Width = Gun @ 360 degrees, will automatically calculate spindle ratio
**If you get errors while doing gun calibration, you may need to reload all files/reboot**

Adjust External Axis Home Position Tolerance
1. Login to Expert User to get access to all directories
2. Deselect SPS to allow file modification
3. Go to KRC:\R1\Mada, then Open $machine.dat
4. After opening $machine.dat go to line ~588 (E6AXIS $H_POS_TOL= ), and then change each external axis in this line to the degree of tolerance you would like.  Save the file and reselect the SPS
5. Run a Cold Boot with Reload All Files to update the "boot files"

ASYNC_MODE Change
Changing this Mode switches whether Block Selection and T1 disables the Asynchronous Axis Selections
1. Login to Expert to get access to all directories. 
2. Deselect SPS to allow file modification. 
3. Go to KRC:\STEU\Mada and then Open $custom.dat
4. After opening $custom.dat go to line ~212 or ~75 and change $ASYNC_MODE from 'B0000' to 'B0010'
5. Run a Cold Boot with Reload All Files to update the "boot files"
Bit 1 controls Block Selection affect on ASYNC_MODE
Bit 0 enables control of ASYPTP motions in the SPS

!!!External Axis with position monitoring in safety configuration must be mastered, they cannot be made asynchronous to ignore the external axis position on master test -- IF these position monitored axis are not needed for human safety then they can be monitored in SPS using User Outputs for interlocking with adjacent robots!!!

ASYNC_AXIS Definition
B'0001' = E1 Asynchronous
B'0010' = E2 Asynchronous
B'0100' = E3 Asynchronous
B'1000' = E4 Asynchronous

Teach EXT TCP
1. Select 5D calibration mode.
2. Choose EXT Tool/Base Frame number to be calibrated, and the TCP used to measure points. 
3. Bring the measuring TCP to the new TCP of the EXT Tool, to measure its TCP. 
4. Then align the EXT Tool +X coordinate pointing towards - Z of robot flange, with +Y of the robot flange facing upwards.  This determines the EXT Tool working direction.

To change which EXT Axis is selected press the number button on the same page as the Couple/Decouple buttons.

Gun Open Distance Setting

Limit how much the gun opens before welding by setting the EG_MOVE_DIST to a lesser value than default (usually 1.) The lower the negative value the less the gun opens. Be cautious setting EG_MOVE_DIST lower, as this could cause movable shank to drive through fixed shank!!!

YOU MUST SET the value back to default value after the welds that require less gun opening distance.

EG_MOVE_DIST = -6


PTP SG14 Vel=100 % PDAT50 ProgNo=120 ServoGun=1 CONT=CLS OPN Part=2 mm Force=3.3 kN ApproxDist=5 mm SpotOffset=0 mm Tool[1]:GUN Base[2]:FIX04

Notes:
- If when opening a EL6900 TwinSAFE a connection is deleted. You need to get the EP6695prim & EP6695sec XML files in your C:/TwinCAT/Io/Ethercat folder
- If approximation not possible, run INI at top of program
- If archiving a robot is not able to successfully complete, you may need to delete excess work visual projects
- SION-CIB inputs 6&7 are for master reference switch (will differ on each cabinet type)
- Without Water Cooling for Welder, must be in Under Construction to Ignore COOL signal in WTC Raft
- If Robot's are looping brake test even after completing, verify the Sodecia PLC SPS file includes this line -----> $OUT[34] = $IN[34]    (passes internal status of brake test requirement to bit that triggers job call in PLC)
- If robot cannot run Tip Wear, check EG_Wear[x] (x = gun number), if the value is very high, reset to 0 in Variable/Single window
- If error "invalid module" when touching up a point, try changing the point and saving it with CMD OK.  This may allow it to be touched up after this
- VPRO-MAX3DKUKA is for WorkVisual, while VPRO-MAX3D is for the Controller
- SG_Lib, SG_Main, and SG_TimerImplCustom file are critical for welding correctly, when welding issues occur, verify these 3 files against known welding robots
- Any fans not operating at correct RPM will prevent robot motion
- Sealant Speed Recommendation - 0.15m/s
- If error "value assignment inadmissible" with ASYNC_AXIS command, may be possible program is opened in EDITOR mode "behind" PROGRAM mode, verify by opening program and closing, then select program and test
